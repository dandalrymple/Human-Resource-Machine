# Human-Resource-Machine
I loved this game. It was a lot of fun and frustrating at times.

I had a very un-PC sort of stream of consciousness text file of playing the game and even with find and replaces, I couldn't take out the stupidity or wrangle the chaos, so I'm going to write a new one as I play through the game again.
