I loved this game. It was a lot of fun and frustrating at times. Here are some of my solutions and thoughts along the way. I'll try to keep this free of profanity but again, I emphasize the frustration factor here.

A few quick and dirty "find and replaces" later and hopefully all the cussing has been scrubbed out. 

The chaos is still there, though.
